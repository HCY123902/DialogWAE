-1 I'm dual booting 2 ubuntu systems (both are 16.04).  Call them OS1 and OS2.  Currently grub is installed from OS1, so update-grub only has an effect when run from OS1.  What is the best way to get the bootloader to automatically update if OS2 has a kernel update? __eou__ 0 groob, I guess the easiest way is to instal grub customizer in os2, and when you update the kernel, also update grub from grub-customizer __eou__ 1 corba: Thanks!  That won't be automated though, right? __eou__ 2 nope, and i dont know if it will correctly update the grub because the past update was in /boot from OS1 __eou__ 3 but you can give it a try, i always use it to update grub graphically, change font, background image... __eou__ 3 corba: Ah ok.  Yea, that's the issue that I'm hitting.  Each OS has a seperate /boot that is updated.  I suspect that the solution would require OS2 to change the /boot location to be the same as OS1. __eou__ 5 groob, you could put /boot on a separate partition :) __eou__ 6 corba: Hmm... You might be on to something there haha __eou__ 7 groob, but why do you need two OS? __eou__ 8 corba: "reasons" __eou__ 8 * genii ponders OS/2 __eou__ 9 groob, virtualization wouldnt do the trick? __eou__ 9 corba: I'm running 2 filesystems and also I just like to keep things isolated. __eou__ 12 corba: I tried virtualization but the performance just isn't that great on my hardware sadly. __eou__ 11 corba: Thanks for the help!  I'll try using a dedicated boot partition instead.  The biggest downside that I can think of is that the partition order in the menu will change depending on which OS ran update-grub last.  If that could be solved, then it would be perfect. __eou__ 14 partition order? __eou__ 15 corba: Err, I mean the order of the operating systems.  OS1 appears first currently, but if OS2 ran update-grub, it would cause OS2 to be listed first. __eou__ 16 groob, you could change that with grub-customizer easily __eou__ 17 corba: Oh, cool.  Good to know!  Thanks! __eou__ 18 you need to install it through the ppa though __eou__ 14 groob: There can be only one boot control authority per hard drive . What I do is disable 30_os-prober in the seconday system,' sudo update-grub' amd in the primary also 'sudo apt-update-grub' to propogate the changes to the system(s) . __eou__ 20 groob: Typo .. sudo apt-update-grub' s/b ' sudo update-grub ' __eou__ 20 Bashing-om: Thanks!  Won't that still require manually running update-grub every time the kernel updates though? __eou__ 22 groob: Yes that is true / 'sudo update-grub ' will be needed ach time the kernel is changed . But that is no big deal, is it ? __eou__ 23 Bashing-om: It's not a huge deal.  It's what I'm currently doing.  I update the kernel in the secondary OS followed by running update-grub within the primary OS. __eou__ 23 Bashing-om: I was just hoping that there was an easy way to automate it, that's all. __eou__ 25 Bashing-om: But thanks! __eou__ 25 groob: My expeprience with out disabling 30_os-prober in my secondary systems is that there is the propability of recurssion in the primary grub.cfg file . __eou__ 27 Bashing-om: Ah, I see.  Currently I just have 2 /boot directories, so nothing conflicts.  When OS2 has a kernel update, it just updates a /boot that is never used.  If I set up a decidated boot partition, I'll take note of that.  Thanks __eou__

No, just the required packages. __eou__ 4 figure002: can you pastebin the command and output you are using/get? __eou__ 1 I installed apache2.. what other packages could I be missing? __eou__ 6 froglok: that depends a lot on your site... __eou__ 5 nacc: http://paste.ubuntu.com/23655644/ __eou__ 8 figure002: are you fully up to date *before* installing collectd? (`apt update; apt full-upgrade`) __eou__ 9 nacc: you mean `dist-upgrade`? yes, my system is fully up-to-date. __eou__ 9 figure002: well, `apt` and `apt-get` have different options, but sure __eou__ 10 figure002: ok, i think it's because librrd pulls in a bunch of stuff __eou__ 10 figure002: you could try 'collectd-core', but not sure if it will get you everyting you want __eou__ 13 nacc: yeah, I just checked that packages, but it seems like I will miss some stuff (e.g. configurations) __eou__ 14 I guess I could just pull the configuration from somewhere, thanks for checking nacc __eou__ 15 figure002: np __eou__ 16 nacc: this is so weird.. check this out: http://paste.ubuntu.com/23655695/ __eou__ 17 what is weird __eou__ 17 apparently Ubuntu installs recommended packages by default? __eou__ 19 yes __eou__ 19 apparnetly,.. __eou__ 21 sysconfig: see my previous posts __eou__ 22 about what __eou__ 23 sysconfig: scroll up a little, it's right there __eou__ 17 collectD : Note: The package does not depend on all packages that are required by all of the plugins ... so if you want all the plugins to work, you need them. __eou__ 25 OerHeks: still makes no sense to me why a daemon would need X11 and such.. __eou__
