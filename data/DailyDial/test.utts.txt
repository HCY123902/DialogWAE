-1 how can I get access to my NTFS files from ubuntu? (fresh newbie asking) :) __eou__ 0 stig_, unfortunately for now it requires a bit of work __eou__ 1 a: you will only be able to read the ntfs files __eou__ 2 b) you wont be able to write to an ntfs partition __eou__ 3 I only need to read from it :) __eou__ 3 ms keeps ntfs info secret, and any interim support for write has essentially dissapeared as no one cares enough to maintain the components __eou__ 4 okay __eou__ 6 then __eou__ 7 1. you need to find your ntfs partition with sudo fdisk -l __eou__ 8 2. you need to create a folder in say /media to wher eyou will mount to the ntfs partition ... mine is /media/ntfs __eou__ 9 3. you need to add info about the partition to your /etc/fstab __eou__ 0 stig_ the ubuntuguide.org is really good on this __eou__ 10 i'll paste a sample that i use __eou__ 12 oh i don't have the line on this system __eou__ 10 holycow: I think I made it it point 3... but dont know how I do that __eou__ 14 google for fstab mount ntfs ... you will get lots of examples of the entry __eou__ 10 the 4. sudo mount /media/ntfs __eou__ 15 ok, thanks __eou__ 16 then 5. you can browse to /metdia/ntfs and read the files from there __eou__ 18 i presume in the future some outomount feature will be available, not sure __eou__ 14 stig_, google step 3 then :) you will need to reaserch a bit, i don't intend on teaching you how to use nano or whatever :) __eou__ 2 dosen't Ubuntu support read/write to NTFS disks? __eou__ 21 read yes __eou__ 21 write no __eou__ 21 no linux distro properly supports ntfs writes __eou__ 24 how/where can I reach it? __eou__ 24 ntfs is proprietary and undocumented, and the project that used the windows dlls to do writing is no longer supported, primarily because no one really cares __eou__ 25 reach what? __eou__ 27 a disk with NTFS file system.

-1 Anyone here successfully installed a 2.6.12 kernel on Hoary? __eou__ 0 I wanted to try 2.6.12 on my Hoary system, but I ran into trouble. First it wouldn't even boot, and when it did my sound card didn't work and I think I recall some other quirks too. __eou__ 1 Vjaz: always wait a couple of months before trying out a new kernel ;) __eou__ 2 delire: Hehhe. Yeah, that's a good idea. :-) __eou__ 2 Vjaz: i have had problems here also, and i've been compiling kernels since v2.1 __eou__ 2 delire, There was an infrared driver patch that I really wanted in 2.6.12. __eou__ 4 delire, Yeah, I'm no stranger to compiling my own kernel. It seems to me that Ubuntu is a different animal than Gentoo or Debian kernel wise. __eou__ 4 Vjaz: i wanted some new bluetooth and Asus stuff.. __eou__ 6 Vjaz: it is a little. i think the best approach with Ubuntu is let the maintainers ship the kernel for you. __eou__ 8 delire, Yeah. I might wait until Breezy I guess. I think I'll need to do a BIOS upgrade on my laptop before I can even use that infrared stuff, so unless I find myself wiping my hard drive to install Windows or buying a USB floppy drive, I don't think it's a problem just yet. __eou__ 9 Vjaz: well given the Ubuntu release cycle, you won't have to wait for long.. another few months __eou__ 10 delire, Yeah, it's nice. I can't use my infrared before that though, but I haven't been able to do that before either, so it's not much of a problem. I might install vanilla Debian or something to see if it works while waiting. __eou__ 11 Vjaz: well i'm going to wait a month or so. i run debian on this lappie __eou__ 12 delire, Ok. It probably is a good idea to wait a while to see that there are no major problems with the kernel, I guess. __eou__

-1 sudo echo fglrx >> /etc/modules | permission denied. Why? __eou__ 0 narkceh, because you're trying to open /etc/modules as a regular user. what you're doing is essentially running "echo fglrx" with sudo and redirecting it to /etc/modules. You should run "sudo -s" or "sudo su -" and then run "echo fglrx >> /etc/modules" __eou__ 0 narkceh - either the "enter password" is being >> to something you don't have rights to yet, or the sudo only applies to the echo fglrx __eou__ 2 Vjaz: ok, thanks. got it. __eou__ 3 narkceh, I do the same thing all the time. It's a bit non-intuitive I guess, but makes sense. :-) __eou__ 4 Vjaz: yeah, this ubuntu is pretty new for me for example I allways forget sudo when installing something. __eou__

__eou__ 6 vee_ how much do you know about partitioning? __eou__ 7 when it comes to linux - 0 __eou__ 8 vee_ how about in windows? ie not linux? __eou__ 9 windows an d mac - yes __eou__ 9 danbhfive: win and mac yes __eou__ 11 vee_ how would you partition in those cases __eou__ 12 vee_ i mean, im not sure if I know what you need, you could just format them both to ext3, set one to mount as / and the other to something like /media/other __eou__ 12 danbhfive most of the available space would go to data, if I have two or more drives I drop my data from one HD to another __eou__ 14 danbhfive: system then two partitions (equal in size but way bigger than system) for data __eou__ 15 vee_ well, if you mount one drive as /, basically everything will go there __eou__ 16 danbhfive: I will be placing my Mac and Windows files on the data partitions as well __eou__ 17 vee_ are you dual booting? or try booting? __eou__ 18 danbhfive: I would like one drive with a good size partition for system and apps, plus a much bigger portion for M and W data backup, while the other drive I want to store just M and W data __eou__ 19 danbhfive: i dont want to ever have a chance of messing up the system (ha) __eou__ 19 vee_ but are you dual booting?  i didnt think you were, are you talking about when you actually setup the ftp? __eou__ 21 danbhfive: at this point no, in the future i will purchase a separate drive for that __eou__ 22 danbhfive: i really want this machine to be a server (another ha) __eou__ 22 vee_ then dont bother with partitioning much, you want to use ALL the space for linux __eou__ 24 vee_ linux will be holding the files for other OS's, in fact, at this point, it doesnt matter __eou__ 25 danbhfive: ok, so should i click on each and partition the entire device __eou__ 26 vee_ yeah, just one big partition for now __eou__ 27 danbhfive: creating new partition tables for each right now __eou__ 28 vee_ you should just get things up and running as close as you can to how you want __eou__ 29 vee_ you can worry about more fancy partitioning later __eou__ 30 danbhfive kewl __eou__ 28 danbhfive ok both say under there sub menus: pri/log 500.1 GB FREE SPACE, im clcking FINISH partitioning and write changes to disk __eou__ 32 danbhfive ok both say under there sub menus: pri/log 500.1 GB FREE SPACE, im clcking FINISH partitioning and write changes to disk, now when I go to finish it says no /root found __eou__ 33 vee_ did you set one of the partitions to /  ? __eou__ 34 danbhfive shoudl one be logical and one be primary? __eou__ 35 vee_ nah __eou__ 36 vee_ thats only if you are breaking up the harddrives into several partitions __eou__ 37 danbhfive im clearing them again (thanx for baring with me) __eou__ 38 danbhfive both say FREE SPACE under them, now what __eou__ 39 vee_  wait, did you informat them? __eou__ 40 danbhfive i clciked manual under the partitioning menu __eou__ 41 ok, i would use synaptic then, and resolve those broken dependencies __eou__ 41 danbhfive then i hit <enter> with each drive selected __eou__ 42 uninstall any package that doesnt have a valid source __eou__ 43 vee_ are the drives formatted at this point? __eou__ 43 danbhfive it then asked me whether or not to create new empty partition table __eou__ 44 how do i get a list of packages that don't have a valid source? __eou__ 46 danbhfive i said yes to both __eou__ 48 danbhfive dioes that mena they are formatted? __eou__ 49 vee_ i dont know __eou__ 50 vee_ its graphical isnt it?  if it says "free space" then its not formated __eou__ 47 Chronosphear look under Installed (local or obsolete) __eou__ 52 get rid of those, unless its something that you personally put there __eou__ 52 danbhfive, ah, thanks __eou__ 51 vee_ you lost me at some point __eou__ 55 danbhfive, no, I'm still here. __eou__ 49 vee_ you should format the drive, AND set the mount point __eou__ 57 danbhfive if I select a dirve then hit <enter> I see a menu for Create a new Partition, Auto part. the free space, or Show Cylinder/head/Sector Info __eou__ 58 danbhfive does that sound familiar? __eou__ 59 is it all freespace right now? __eou__ 60 yes __eou__ 61 both drives __eou__ 62 vee_ ok, yes, click create a new drive button, where ever that is __eou__ 63 vee_ then select ext3, and then look for a place to set the mount point __eou__ 64 vee_ set the mount point to / __eou__ 65 danbhfive ok but first i have to select logical or primary to get to that menu __eou__ 66 danbhfive which one? __eou__ 67 primary __eou__ 68 logical is if you are creating more than 4 partitions, and you are only making one __eou__ 68 vee_ did it work? __eou__ 70 danbhfive  ok I have this set for the first drive.... Use as= Ext3 journaling file sys. Mount point=  /home,  Mount options= defaults, Label= None, reserved Blocks= 5%, Typical usage= standard, bootable flag= off __eou__ 71 danbhfive  hows that? __eou__ 71 vee_ the mount point should be just / __eou__ 73 danbhfive  ok __eou__ 54 danbhfive, the applets are still broken. any other ideas? __eou__ 75 vee_ Chronospear did you successfully run sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^ ? __eou__ 75 Chronospear did you successfully run sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^ ? __eou__ 77 no, it keeps getting stock on libnss and firefox __eou__ 78 stuck* __eou__ 78 hrmm that's weird __eou__ 74 danbhfive  what should I set the second drive to  logical or primary? then i can get to the menu to set the other options __eou__ 81 or just leave it as free space __eou__ 80 Chronospear well, I dont know about the applets, but you still dont yet have a full ubuntu install __eou__ 81 vee_ do it the same as the first, with a different mount point __eou__ 83 danbhfive, when i do apt-get autoremove it says there is nothing to uninstall BUT when i got to install libnss it says: __eou__ 85 The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required: __eou__ 86 planner ekiga libgsf-gnome-1-114 libpth20 libgoffice-0-common abiword-gnome dia-libs gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly rhythmbox abiword-common __eou__ 87 seahorse gnumeric-common gnome-themes-extras fast-user-switch-applet dia-gnome gnome-backgrounds libgoffice-0-4 libopal-2.2 libdvdread3 __eou__ 85 libsidplay1 dia-common gnumeric libgpgme11 inkscape libmpeg2-4 liba52-0.7.4 __eou__ 85 Use 'apt-get autoremove' to remove them. __eou__ 85 The following packages will be REMOVED __eou__ 85 oops, sorry __eou__ 84 vee_ /media/<whatever you want> __eou__ 85 Chronospear just do it, and run the install desktop command before you reboot __eou__ 94 danbhfive, do what? manually uninstall? __eou__ 95 install the libnss? __eou__ 95 autoremove does nothing __eou__ 93 danbhfive  /can/this/be/like/this __eou__ 97 did you remove all the local packages? __eou__ 99 oh right ok __eou__ 98 danbhfive  or must i start off /home/something/else __eou__ 98 vee_ it can, heh, but dont confuse yourself __eou__ 102 vee_ it should be under /media __eou__ 100 ooook __eou__ 104 it's uninstalling gnome __eou__ 103 danbhfive ok media/myStuff __eou__ 106 danbhfive doesnt give me media in the list so i entered it manually __eou__ 101 vee_ /home is good for reinstalling linux, but that can come when you are more familiar with this stuff __eou__ 107 vee_ thats fine __eou__ 108 danbhfive kewl __eou__ 110 danbhfive thanx for the patience __eou__ 111 np __eou__ 105 Chronosphear, can I pm you? __eou__ 113 danbhfive, sure __eou__

Does your mp3 player work with Linux/Ubuntu? __eou__ 9 yes it works fine __eou__ 10 i use rockbox firmware on my mp3 player, when i boot the mp3 players original firmware it makes the music folder hidden, rockbox cannot find the hidden music folder __eou__ 11 blkthndr: and copying the folder is unacceptable? __eou__ 12 I could copy the folder but its a huge folder __eou__ 13 and the problem will create itself again in the future __eou__ 14 blkthndr: I understand but it should be visible. __eou__ 15 its visible to linux and ubuntu and a mac, rockbox does not see it becaues it is a windows hidden file.  when i had windows i could just unhide it, i can't do this using ubuntu because its not hidden to it __eou__ 16 blkthndr: that's a predicament. __eou__ 17 there are ways around it so i can access my music, but i just want to know if the problem can be fixed __eou__ 18 blkthndr: maybe you can be more specific. it does sound like a hardware issue that is solvable. __eou__ 19 but I'm at a loss as to why someone would hide a music folder. __eou__ 19 Its not a hardware issue.  I'm just trying to change the hidden status of a folder, the problem is its a windows hidden folder and not a linux hidden folder __eou__ 21 blkthndr: there-in lies the problem __eou__ 22 so there is no way I can change its hidden status without using windows? __eou__ 22 blkthndr: perhaps linux would be able to read AMIGA floppy disks as well? Nope. aint gonna happen. __eou__ 24 slightly different problem but none-the-less... it aint gonna happen. __eou__ 23 blkthndr: try googling it. __eou__ 26 i've tried googling with no help for a couple days, as well as trying the support forums and irc of rockbox __eou__

BUT, it's segfaulting in my VM (possibly due to lack of 3d support?  which this VM doesn't have.  or perhaps because it's still buggy ;)  but i can't verify if it needs 3d or not... __eou__ 26 zykotick9, it could be. i still think it requires opengl capable graphics drivers :P __eou__ 26 kostkon: by way of comparison, lxde is a 270MB download! __eou__ 28 zykotick9, hmm weird __eou__ 28 kostkon: e17 is CRAZY light man... __eou__ 30 zykotick9, lol __eou__ 23 I rember back ages ago when E was heavy. ;) but that was when a Pent 100 was high end. ;P __eou__ 32 Dr_Willis: true :p __eou__ 32 i remember when i thought @500mhz was blazing fast __eou__ 34 how times change __eou__ 28 zykotick9, hmm 270 v 30. it's a lot. dont know where is coming from. maybe because lubuntu-desktop has a long list of deps. however, just the lxde package alone depends on much fewer packages. __eou__ 36 kostkon: that 270 is just the lxde package(s) ;)  it's ALMOST finished installing. __eou__ 37 zykotick9, oh ok __eou__ 34 xmetal; now I think my 2.7ghz Dual Core is slow, lol. __eou__ 38 kostkon: lxde ends up pulling in, quite a bit of gnome (i guess understandably), which explains it's MUCH larger size than e17.  BUT... e17 failed on my VM, lxde works OOTB!  so my scorecard: e17 = 0 vs lxde = 1 (there is a clear winner from where i sit ;)  thanks for reminding me that e17 exists, and that it's still isn't up to "my" quality standards ;)  [i enjoyed the "test" though :) ] __eou__ 40 zykotick9, :) __eou__

So I need a "diff" of files first __eou__ 6 a diff of the file list ideally __eou__ 7 marscher: diff /directory1 /directory2 __eou__ 8 histo, does this work recursively and for binary files?! __eou__ 8 histo, a line by line comparision for 200k files would be total overkill, despite I only need to find out, which files has been deleted __eou__ 10 marscher: I'm thinking about it. But i'm extremely tired, give me a few __eou__ 11 histo, np, take your time ;) __eou__ 10 marscher: try diff -qr /dir1 /dir2 __eou__ 13 marscher: using that if a only in results in a directory then it won't recurse further because there is no point. e.g. only in /dir1: somedir   then it won't go into somedir __eou__ 14 marscher: also try with rsync -rnu dir1 dir2  should only show files that will be overwritten __eou__ 15 marscher: -u is the key __eou__ 16 histo, thanks for all this information, but I currently noticed, that I cant perform any of them in my current environment, since I've mounted an btrfs image, which shares the same uuid like an already mounted volume.... __eou__ 17 and it seems, there is no way around this. __eou__ 18 so I guess I first have to transfer all files from the backup image to another filesystem (which is superstupid... :() __eou__ 17 marscher: can't you mount by label? __eou__ 20 histo, my research so far results, that the uuid is stored inherently in the filesystem(image) __eou__ 21 and is not changeable __eou__ 21 marscher: how do you have matching uuid's what are you trying to do? __eou__ 22 so how would a label change that? __eou__ 23 trying to mount an image of my currently running system on a loopback device __eou__ 25 marscher: ahh __eou__ 25 but because those uuids are the same (image and source), the mounted image shows exactly the same contents like current __eou__ 27 funy :D __eou__ 27 histo, https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/104067/modifying-a-btrfs-filesystem-uuid __eou__ 27 marscher: you can set the uuid with tune2fs __eou__ 30 tune2fs for btrfs??? __eou__ 31 marscher: nope just caught that you were using btrfs __eou__ 31 marscher: tune2fs does not work on brtfs afaik __eou__ 33 k0nceast, yes that is what one would expect __eou__ 34 marscher: i think everything should go through the btrfs or btrfsctl commands __eou__ 32 * histo thinks no one should be using btrfs __eou__ 35 the 'man btrfs' page might give you a better explanation (probability of man vs me being correct is far higher than 'might') and otherwise look into the btrfs-utils package __eou__ 37 k0nceast, histo, there is no way documentated to perform this.

-1 Hey, I have an Ubuntu live USB booted. I've installed some things and am wondering if I can make a persistant overlay with what I currently have? I googled around, but all I can find is stuff on creating the overlay, not saving current stuff to it. I know there must be some way, but I'm kinda stuck. __eou__ 0 Guest19759: not while you're booted __eou__ 1 Guest19759: it's a boot-time kernel option iirc __eou__ 2 k0nceast: Yeah, but is there some way to just dump the changes to a file and then reboot from it? __eou__ 3 depends on what you've changed __eou__ 4 you could make a folder on your windrive and save all changed config files there __eou__ 5 (eg. the files and folders in your home folder that start with a . (dot), hidden by default __eou__ 6 Guest19759: but that doesn't count for everything __eou__ 7 eg. added apps __eou__ 8 k0nceast: Yeah, the apps are mainly what I want to save. I know I could just re-add Universe and reinstall the stuff I've gotten, but I wonder if there's a way to create the persistant file and dump everything that's changed since boot or something __eou__ 9 Guest19759: if you've added repo's for apps, then add the /etc/sources.list file and /etc/sources.d/ dir to the folder __eou__ 10 w8 __eou__ 10 /etc/dpkg/sources.list and .d respectively __eou__ 12 and in the dpkg folder might also be a list with names of installed packages, which you could copy there as well __eou__ 9 !clone | Guest19759 __eou__ 14 Guest19759: To replicate your packages selection on another machine (or restore it if re-installing), you can use the !software package "apt-clone" - See also !automate __eou__ 13 Guest19759: and when installed, you could replace the content of the file in the install with the content of the files on your winpartition __eou__ 15 histo: No way!!! __eou__ 17 that'd saved me hours if i'd known that some years earlier __eou__ 16 Ah ok. Would be a neet feature at some point though to be able to create a persistant file from what currently is. Thanks all for your help and suggestions, though. __eou__ 18 k0nceast: you could easily dpkg --get-selections > somefile __eou__ 20 k0nceast: nad --set-selections on the other side __eou__ 21 k0nceast: and then you can install them. __eou__ 22 im on arch nowadays __eou__ 23 k0nceast: same here __eou__ 23 i have Ubuntu for my SO and a few of my friends (I switched them) __eou__ 25 people are a lot easier to switch nowadays, since android and iPhones __eou__ 26 maybe b/c people are known to the idea of finding alternative apps/workflows than Windows __eou__ 27 k0nceast: you'll probably find its because its lighter and fater and more works out of the box __eou__ 28 ActionParsnip: what's lighter and faster? __eou__ 29 histo: ubuntu uses a lot fewer resources than windows in most cases __eou__ 30 histo: Mainly becouse ti does not have as much bloatware as windows __eou__ 31 * histo **cough **cough Amazon **cough **cough __eou__ 32 histo: Well we all disable that after a while right __eou__

Is there a way to check the boot details etc. any advice? __eou__ 0 latest LTS __eou__ 0 user123321: upgraded recently? tried an older kernel? __eou__ 2 daftykins, clean install. __eou__ 3 daftykins, and, no. __eou__ 3 have you upgraded it since said clean install? __eou__ 5 daftykins, just clean install, didn't do major changes intentionally, other than software update and some software installs. __eou__ 5 daftykins, no. I installed the latest version. __eou__ 6 user123321: so due to said software update (== upgrade) you may have another kernel on __eou__ 8 user123321: either look for another or run memtest i'd say __eou__ 9 daftykins, I see. But Ubuntu asks me to update right? hmm. __eou__ 9 daftykins, I'd do memtest? __eou__ 10 user123321: what do you mean asks you to update? __eou__ 12 daftykins, Ubuntu shows "new updates are available" __eou__ 13 but you said it's not booting... __eou__ 14 daftykins, I make sure things are up to date. __eou__ 14 daftykins, It didn't this morning for 2 consecutive times, but I booted successfully after. This is what freaking me out :/ __eou__ 16 user123321: oh... i misunderstood, by hang you mean it just takes a lot longer __eou__ 17 daftykins, I had to turn off manually. __eou__ 18 oh, you got in on the third go? :) __eou__ 18 user123321: yeah straight to memtest then. i don't diagnose anything until that's clean __eou__ 19 daftykins, Yes, I went to ubuntu recovery, it booted.

"sudo modprobe -v psmouse". The first one will disable it, the 2nd one should re-enable it, hopefully properly. __eou__ 7 varunendra: nop, kernel does not uses psmouse __eou__ 8 eric_tux, how did you check? lsmod? __eou__ 7 the first -rv command does nothing __eou__ 10 then I -v , got insmod psmouse __eou__ 11 -rv got rmmod psmouse __eou__ 12 so I guess the psmouse wasn't loaded the first time __eou__ 13 eric_tux, I would like to see the outputs of (pastebin links of) "xinput" and "lsmod" __eou__ 14 varunendra: http://paste.ubuntu.com/7664317/ __eou__ 15 eric_tux, apparently it is "BCM5974". You may try replacing 'psmouse' with 'bcm5974' in the modprobe commands. But I have no experience with it, so can't say if it may cause any troubles forcing you to reboot. __eou__ 16 is bcm5974 linked with the wifi card?

(xinput float bcm5974.... then .... xinput reattach bcm5974 Virtual core pointer) __eou__ 22 ok __eou__ 22 eric_tux, a correction - the "Virtual core pointer" must be in single or double quotes, since it has spaces in the name. :) __eou__ 24 On my laptop I have 8Go RAM installed, is it normal to find more than 6Go used reported by top (when this problem arrives), swap is totally free? __eou__ 25 eric_tux, totally normal.

I am just trying everything I can find. __eou__ 3 is this a new install of xubuntu? __eou__ 7 I've had it on this machine for a couple weeks. __eou__ 8 you got anything on that is important, cos without knowing what you done this could take forever __eou__ 9 Are we talking about wiping and reinstalling? __eou__ 10 galentanner: yes, if need be __eou__ 11 There is no way to find out what is running and shut it down? __eou__ 11 or you could just use wired until your new usb wifi stick comes __eou__ 13 I guess so. __eou__ 12 well sure, you can `sudo fuser /var/lib/dpkg/lock` to get a list of processes that have that file open, but just shutting it down may not really help __eou__ 15 Would that tell us what is running and causing this? __eou__ 16 it gives you a PID, a process id __eou__ 17 ok..I did that it came back "2335" __eou__ 18 then `ps aux | grep 2335` __eou__ 19 galentanner@ubuntu:~$ ps aux | grep 2335 __eou__ 20 root      2335  0.0  0.0  19560    88 ?

Do you have a terminal open somewhere thats running apt-get ? __eou__ 24 or aptitude, or i bet ubuntu has a few other programs these days (i cant keep up) __eou__ 24 I have one open that I'm using to do the commands. __eou__ 21 try `ps auf`, that should draw some nice lines between parents and children to ee who owns the dpkg --configure process __eou__ 27 you'll have to look through it for the dpkg line, then trace back the lines its draws __eou__ 28 I'm not smart enough for that.. __eou__ 27 galentanner@ubuntu:~$ ps auf __eou__ 30 USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND __eou__ 31 galenta+  3339  0.0  0.2  22756  1052 pts/6    Ss   22:03   0:00 bash __eou__ 32 galenta+  3437  0.0  0.2  18440  1232 pts/6    R+   22:16   0:00  \_ ps auf __eou__ 33 root      1392  4.3  3.7 240756 16188 tty7     Ss+  21:54   0:56 /usr/bin/X -cor __eou__ 30 you'll have to use a paste site for more than a couple lines :) __eou__ 35 but basically you see the line it drew from ps auf to bash?  wherever your dpkg --configure -a is, it should have similar lines.  If not means its unparented __eou__ 35 http://pastebin.com/d33DTtN4 __eou__ 37 it is unattached,  i forgot you need `ps auxf`,  the x shows the unattached processes __eou__ 38 should I run the " ps auxf "? __eou__ 39 yes __eou__ 37 just guessing, but with it showing a ? for TTY its probably spawned from a GUI program __eou__ 41 rather than a shell __eou__ 38 http://pastebin.com/gbf6mxL1 __eou__ 43 I think my head is about to explode. __eou__ 43 you can try `sudo kill 3280`, basically it looks like dpkg is configuring some package(can't tell becaue it cuts off on the right hand side), and the modprobe command is stuffed __eou__ 45 ok __eou__ 45 done __eou__ 47 ps auxf again,  is modprobe still listed with a line drawn to it from dpkg --configure? __eou__ 48 reasonable chance since modprobe talks directly to the kernel that a plain kill wasn't enough.  TBH the "easiest" way might just be a reboot (hard reboot if necessary) __eou__ 48 http://pastebin.com/nWAaGzYN __eou__ 50 dpkg looks to no longer be listed, in theory that also means dpkg is no longer locked and whatever you were trying to do with it should be possible now __eou__ 49 What's the difference between a reboot and a hard reboot? __eou__ 52 galentanner: a hard reboot is when you just shut off the power without letting the machine do a proper shutdown __eou__ 53 oh.  ok. __eou__ 51 I'm trying to get the Broadcom 4318 wireless card to work.  Everyone says it's supported, but I can't get it to work. __eou__ 53 galentanner: not generally suggested, although not as dangerous now as it used to be :) but can be necessary when things that talk to the kernel get stuffed and refuse to complete (but not necessary in your current situation) __eou__ 56 ok __eou__ 55 getting hardware to work is a pain in the ass, i have an IT department that chooses laptops for me :) __eou__ 58 Nice.  I am the IT department.  I'm an idiot.  I just want it to work... __eou__ 59 :) __eou__ 55 I'm trying to run these commands: __eou__ 61 sudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source __eou__ 61 sudo apt-get install linux-firmware-nonfree __eou__ 63 Should I try them now? __eou__ 64 sounds reasonable __eou__ 65 here goes.... __eou__ 66 I think the first one is working now. __eou__ 67 The first command seems to have finished.  Should I reboot or run the second command? __eou__ 68 just run the next one, you hardly need to reboot a linux box __eou__ 69 ok... __eou__ 69 second one is chewing __eou__ 71 linux-firmware-nonfree is already the newest version. __eou__ 72 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 11 not upgraded. __eou__ 73 Is this ok? __eou__ 72 it means the package is installed, and thats what you wanted, so i guess yes? __eou__ 75 So the website calls for a couple modprobe commands next.... __eou__ 76 sudo modprobe -rv b43 __eou__ 77 sudo modprobe -v b43 __eou__ 78 basically that means remove and re-insert the b43 driver __eou__ 79 ok... __eou__ 79 (you can `man modprobe` to get a manual page explaining all of this) __eou__ 81 man is the manual command, works for most all things you can type into the command line __eou__ 82 quality of the manual varies greatly though :) __eou__ 79 This is what I did.. __eou__ 84 galentanner@ubuntu:~$ sudo modprobe -rv b43 __eou__ 85 galentanner@ubuntu:~$ sudo modprobe -v b43 __eou__ 86 insmod /lib/modules/3.13.0-46-generic/kernel/drivers/ssb/ssb.ko __eou__ 87 The website says I may need to reboot now.  Should I? __eou__ 88 it seems odd they want you to remove and reinsert the kernel module, then reboot.  but sure why not __eou__ 89 Then the wireless should be working, you think? __eou__ 90 a definite maybe :) __eou__ 91 I'll be back in a jif....BTW, thanks for the help.

That's awesome! __eou__ 115 #justircthings __eou__ 97 Thanks all.  I've read that fixing the wireless might allow the computer to actually poweroff.  What do you think? __eou__ 117 depends why it wont power off ) __eou__ 117 ...? what was the problem originally __eou__ 118 sometimes if it wont power off you can ctrl-alt-F7 (or F1, F2, try them all) to end up at a screen that has some debug output __eou__ 120 but only sometimes __eou__ 119 It just sits there and runs after restart or shutdown command either from GUI or from the command line.  I have to unplug the battery and the power cord to get it to shut off. __eou__ 122 also instead of unplugging everything, many computers and laptops will force a shutdown if you just hold the power button for >5s __eou__ 123 I've tried that.  doesn't work here. __eou__ 124 :( __eou__ 120 So, If I use the shutdown command in the gui system.  The screen will go black.  After a few minutes, I, Instead of unplugging everything, try the ctrl-alt- F7...etc.  That should generate some code? __eou__ 126 if your lucky, one of them will have some debug output on them.  Its not really generated at that point though basically those are virtual terminals that always exist but are not typically seen these days because everything boots straight into GUI __eou__ 127 SO, If is hit those buttons, the system will send the report the next startup? __eou__ 128 sorry no, i mean those are text consoles (like the one you type your commands into in the gui) that still exist from the days before GUI was popular __eou__ 129 if you are lucky some debug output goes to one of them when shutting down __eou__ 130 they wont persist through a reboot __eou__ 131 so, I'll see the output, write it downand send it out. __eou__ 132 a picture with your phone might be easier than writing it down :) __eou__ 133 ok.  I can send that to you if I get anything? __eou__ 134 you can just post it here __eou__ 135 ok  I'll see you guys in the ether!  PEacE!  and thanks again! __eou__ 136 Ladies and Gentlemen.

I havent tried using it with a partition but if I use dd to destroy a file, it takes slightly longer depending on if its a hdd, ssd, whats io operations going on on disk, etc __eou__ 0 darius93: If you're using dd on a disk, it's using 512 bytes by default, which is extremely slow. If you were to use 32M for example for the byte size, it would go much more quickly. __eou__ 1 Ah that explains it but I generally use 1M __eou__ 2 darius93: I've also found shred to be a little slow, but I've never done a side-by-side. They are both binaries that do different things, so yeah. __eou__ 3 rypervenche, i never used it against a drive itself, just files to securely erase them, but i guess it varies. Shred does do several passes through the file (i think 4 or 24 passes by default) which is why it is slower than dd which only does one pass through __eou__ 4 darius93: Yep, there is that as well. 3 by default. __eou__

-1 what kind of file .zsync is ? what to do with it ? zetheroo1 http://mirror.yandex.ru/ubuntu-cdimage/releases/14.04.2/release/ __eou__ 0 newuser789: zsync is a way to download similar files without downloading everything each time __eou__ 1 geirha: just like torrent or something else ? and how to use it ? __eou__ 2 newuser789: the file is split into sizable pieces, then checksums for each piece is stored in the .zsync file.  When you download with zsync, you provide it with similar files you've already downloaded. It checks those files if they have any matching pieces, and only downloads any missing ones. __eou__ 3 newuser789: It's mainly for the daily images, where today's and yesterday's image likely only contains a few differences. So you might end up downloading 10% of the actual size instead of 100% __eou__ 4 geirha: sounds like its same as torrent, files are split and their hashes are stored in torrent file, when we download then it checks for missing pieces and downloads the missing ones __eou__ 5 newuser789: similar, sure, but you only download from the one server, not other peers __eou__ 6 geirha: ohh, so zsync is centralized to a single server and torrent is decentralized to seeds and peers, torrents can be dangerous but zsync will be verified by server __eou__ 7 so how to use zsync ? __eou__ 8 sorry but I don't know __eou__ 8 newuser789: read this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ZsyncCdImage __eou__ 10 but you could just md5sum for the isos __eou__ 11 k1l: what are md5sums-metalink, md5sums-metalink.gpg and md5sums.gpg files ? what I know is that gpg is an encryption tool and how to use these files ? __eou__ 12 newuser789: read this for md5sum checks https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM __eou__ 13 k1l: the page has no mention to md5sums-metalink and md5sums-metalink.gpg https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM __eou__ 14 what link? __eou__ 15 https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM __eou__ 16 files here ---> http://mirror.yandex.ru/ubuntu-cdimage/releases/14.04.2/release/ __eou__ 17 newuser789: you are using wubi? __eou__ 18 k1l: wubi ? __eou__ 19 newuser789: they are/were used for the wubi installer. but that is not recommended anymore __eou__ 20 no, I'm downloading ubuntu 14.04.2 and 14.10 images for installation so asking about md5sums, same-metalink and same-metalink.gpg files. I already downloaded md5sums and x64 images and I know how to check md5sums.

I didn't try to connect to from within the system __eou__ 15 rypervenche: Yes, I did all those changes yesterday __eou__ 16 sre-su: Either you did try to connect and you didn't realize, or some program is misconfigured, or some program is trying to connect locally. __eou__ 18 sre-su: It didn't say what user it was trying to connect as. __eou__ 18 rypervenche: Thanks __eou__

For now, you should continue to use Java 8 because Oracle Java 9 is available as an early access release (it should be released in 2016)!

__eou__ 91 * tgm4883 wonders if it's not a java issue... __eou__ 95 its installed fine i think its just a matter of configuring JAVA_HOME now __eou__ 93 it says this /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java __eou__ 98 good ok now copy that exactly into your clipboard __eou__ 99 and now run export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java __eou__ 99 clipboard..?

could've sworn that it had to be left out __eou__ 115 negative. says the same thing :( __eou__ 117 should i give up lol __eou__ 113 silvian: closing and reopening the terminal wipes the export __eou__ 119 yeah __eou__ 119 should add it to .bashrc __eou__ 121 well, should export it first and see if it works __eou__ 121 only add it to .bashrc if it works __eou__ 123 true __eou__ 117 yeah repeat the export task again in bash terminal __eou__ 119 silvian: also, you set his java_home wrong __eou__ 125 export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java   ??

Because it doesn't really seem like a support issue __eou__ 23 tgm4883, it's about getting to know how much time passed from mozillas offical release until available in ubuntu15 __eou__ 24 latenite_: but why __eou__ 25 tgm4883, to compare to other distros.

-1 Hey everyone. I was wondering if anyone knows a tool like fuser or lsof that works on FUSE filesystems when they crash __eou__ 0 fuse file system ? __eou__ 1 it's not actually a file system, it's just how it's presented to the user over the network __eou__ 2 eg: samba - is not actually a file system __eou__ 0 specifically, if MooseFS or LizardFS or GlusterFS FUSE client crashes, with dir /storage/lfs as the mountpoint, I can't umount /storage/lfs until I kill anything using it. lsof and fuser however are useless in this scenario and do not work with crashed FUSE mountpoints __eou__ 2 ikonia: in this case I'm talking about actual filesystems. I'm aware FUSE is for other stuff too __eou__ 5 Gnomethrower: what file system are you actually talking about then __eou__ 6 ikonia: LizardFS in this case, but we've seen the same behaviour from Gluster and MooseFS __eou__ 7 Gnomethrower: isn't this the same situation as any remote userspace mount, as then the mount goes the userdata/status is lost __eou__ 8 so when you remount tools like lsof won't show anything __eou__ 9 so you fix it on the server which the file system is not a userspace mount, it's a local file system __eou__ 9 ikonia: I'm not worried about remounting losing the status __eou__ 11 ikonia: I'm wanting to unmount it from a client, but it won't let me while for example nginx is running __eou__ 12 and usually lsof/fuser would tell you what to kill to be able to successfully umount __eou__ 13 but lsof and fuser do not work on a crashed FUSE mountpoint __eou__ 14 okay, apparently this is a kernel limitation and there's really no easy solution __eou__ 15 so consider my question solved I guess __eou__

Wondering if anyone could advise on something im trying to figure out with ulimits and differences between 1604 & 1404 LTS versions __eou__ 0 when making changes to /etc/security/limits.conf in 1604 it doesnt seem i need to add anything like "session required         pam_limits.so" __eou__ 1 to my common sessions for it to pickup the ulimit changes __eou__ 2 but with 1404 without those changes the user in question wont get the limits edit... __eou__ 3 does anyone know if this is maybe something to do with systemd and logind..? i can see pam_systemd mentioned now in common-sessions as standard in 1604. __eou__ 4 Any help or advice would be great cheers. __eou__ 3 jimbotux: interesting so are you seeing limits being updated real time ? __eou__ 6 ikonia, so i make the change then sudo su - USERNAME and changes are there in 1604 __eou__ 7 jimbotux: ahh, that isn't a surprise __eou__ 8 as that is a session parameter __eou__ 9 ikonia, but 1404 nothing until i add the common sessions. __eou__ 10 jimbotux: that sort of makes sense __eou__ 11 ikonia, Could you explain why please?
